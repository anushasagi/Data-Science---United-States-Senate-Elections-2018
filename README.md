# Data-Science---United-States-Senate-Elections-2018
Performed exploratory data analysis and created different regression, classification and clustering to predict the number of votes received for each party. 

Part 1 (Data Preparation & Hypothesis Testing)- Readme

Instructions to Run Code 

1. Download zip file 
2. Make sure the folder contains three csv files (demographics_train.csv, election_train.csv, and State_codes.csv).  
3. Open the python file in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab and run the code segments.

Note: If there are issues running the code for task #10, check to see if pyshp, plotly, shapely, and geopandas packages are properly installed. Otherwise run the following commands using the command line interface of your choosing:


$ conda install -c anaconda pyshp
$ conda install -c anaconda plotly
$ conda install -c anaconda shapely
$ conda install -c anaconda geopandas


Part 2 (Precditive Modeling - Machine Learning Algorithms)- Readme

Instructions to Run Code

	- merged_train.csv
	- demographics_test.csv
	- output.xlsx
2. Open the python file in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab and run the code segments
